# Max Hauri maxSMART 2.0 Adapter

Integrates the Max Hauri maxSMART 2.0 clip-clap Switch WiFi with the Mozilla IoT gateway.

May also support other devices made by Revogi.

## Pairing

The adapter doesn't support any of the pairing protocols nor the cloud API used by the app. This means you have to manually set up your smart plug using the official app. After you have it set up, you can then go into the app and get the serial number ("S/N") in the device details. To get the IP, you'll likely have to log in to your router. Enter those two things in the configuration details of the adapter.

After that, the switch should show up in the pairing screen. Note that you have to manually set the name and the initial power state may be wrong.
