# Max Hauri maxSMART 2.0 Adapter

Integrates the Max Hauri maxSMART 2.0 clip-clap Switch WiFi with the Mozilla IoT gateway.

May also support other devices made by Revogi.

## Pairing

The adapter can do the initial WiFi set up for your maxSMART 2.0 plug. Note that this will leak your WiFi credentials to anyone that can see your WiFi. I recommend disabling the WiFi pairing feature when there are no new plugs to pair in the add-on configuration.

I also recommend to use the adapter to pair and not the official app, since that will upload your WiFi credentials to a server.
